Catering for this diversity means that our educational publishers are flexible and develop resources that work for students from a range of cultures. New Zealand’s success in exporting educational publishing is further testament to our ability to meet the needs of educational markets worldwide.</p>      <p>Educational publishing plays an important role in the revitalisation of New Zealand’s first language, te reo Māori (the Māori language). Our educational publishers working in te reo Māori can bring their expertise in first-nations’ language publishing to partners throughout the world.</p>      <p>New Zealand educational publishers ensure their resources support the curriculum and standards of the country they’re publishing for. At primary and secondary level, we have the expertise to produce resources that align with your market’s curriculum and standards.</p>    </div>		<div id="footer_graphic_container"><img id="footer_graphic" src="images/p5_footer_graphic.png" alt="p5_footer_graphic.png"/></div></body></html>
